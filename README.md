# Java developer: Stack Exchange searcher
Scenario  
Create a Java web application with a form that allows a user to enter a search string, queries Stack Exchange to find questions with titles containing that string, and display the results.  
  
Requirements  
Display the results in a tabular format showing at least the date of the question, its title and who posted it. If the question has been answered, use a visual style to differentiate it from unanswered questions. The displayed item should have a means to navigate to the original question on Stack Exchange. You may use any resource, library, example code or documentation you can find on the web.
